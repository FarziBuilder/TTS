I just need to collect all the pieces. Wow! Look at this, Bhim. It's like a pretty little rainbow. Remember? Uncle was telling us a story yesterday, about how the rainbow got made. Which story? The story of a very powerful dragon who made a rainbow in the sky, so that he could defeat the cruel Hazzoc. Really? And I thought a rainbow is formed when rays of the sun fall on water droplets and turn direction, and that's when we see the seven colours. This is something that went over our heads. As if you both understand everything that you're told. If we did, we would not have been with you. What did you say? I'll show you about it. Actually, now's the right weather for the rainbow to be seen. But for that, it has to rain too.|Mummy! I'm sorry, professor. I only wanted to stop the robot from hurting Kalya, not break it.
